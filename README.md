### Monty Hall Simulation
Gives empirical proof that switching doors is the optimal strategy in the Monty Hall problem through Monte Carlo simulation.

### Lightbulb Survivability
Models lightbulb lifetime using exponential distributions, demonstrating accurate predictions from minimal measurements.

### Sierpinski Triangle
Shows how simple recursive rules generate complex fractal structures.

### Hopfield Associative Memory
Evidence of the Hopfield network's ability to store and retrieve patterns, even with noise up to a limit.
